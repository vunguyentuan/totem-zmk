## Dongle Flashing

Dongle configs use Seeed Xiao Ble microcontrollers housed in a nifty 3D printed [case](https://www.printables.com/model/522586-seeed-xiao-ble-case).

1. Turn all controllers off
2. Flash the dongle controller with the **appropriate** `settings_reset` file.
3. Flash the dongle controller with the `dongle` file.
4. Flash the first half with the the `settings_reset` file.
5. Flash the first half with the `left` or `right` files.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the other half.

> [!WARNING]  
> When using both Nice!Nano and Seeed XIAO microcontrollers, make sure you are flashing them with the correct files!
